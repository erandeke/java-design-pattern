Intent
Collection Pipeline introduces Function Composition and Collection Pipeline, two functional-style patterns 
that you can combine to iterate collections in your code.
In functional programming, it's common to sequence complex operations through a series of smaller modular functions or operations. 
The series is called a composition of functions, or a function composition. 
When a collection of data flows through a function composition, it becomes a collection pipeline.
Function Composition and Collection Pipeline are two design patterns frequently used in functional-style programming.



Applicability
Use the Collection Pipeline pattern when

When you want to perform a sequence of operations where one operation's collected output is fed into the next
When you use a lot of statements in your code
When you use a lot of loops in your code
